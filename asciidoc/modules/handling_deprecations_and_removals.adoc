= Handling deprecations and removals

Some features and functions have been deprecated or removed in {VertX} {v5}. Before you migrate your applications to {VertX} {v5}, check for deprecations and removals.

* Some APIs were deprecated in an {VertX} {v4x} release and new equivalent APIs were provided in that release.

* The deprecated APIs have been removed in {VertX} {v5}.

If your application uses a deprecated API, you should update your application to use the new API. This helps in migrating applications to the latest version of the product.

The Java compiler generates warnings when deprecated APIs are used. You can use the compiler to check for deprecated methods while migrating applications to {VertX} {v5}.
