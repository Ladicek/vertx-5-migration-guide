= Embracing the future model

{VertX} 4 extended the 3.x callback asynchronous model to a future/callback hybrid model, to facilitate migration from Vert.x 3.

Every callback method has a matching future method:

[source,java]
----
public interface HttpClient {

   // Future version
   Future<HttpClientRequest> request(RequestOptions request);

   // Callback version
   void request(RequestOptions request, Handler<AsyncResult<HttpClientRequest>> callback);
   ...
}
----

{VertX} {v5} only retains the future model and thus the callback model is gone, instead you get:

[source,java]
----
public interface HttpClient {

   // Future version
   Future<HttpClientRequest> request(RequestOptions request);
   ...
}
----

Callback methods {VertX} {v4x} are not deprecated methods, however after the release of {VertX} {v5}, the callback
methods shall be deprecated in order to facilitate the migration to {VertX} {v5}.
