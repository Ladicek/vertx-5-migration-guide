= Components sunsets and removals

A few components are sunsetting in {v5}, that means they are still supported for the lifetime of the {v5x} series,
but we donâ€™t encourage using them anymore since we provide replacements for them. Such components are scheduled
to go away in the next major release ({VertX} 6).

Here is the list of components sunsetting in {v5}:
